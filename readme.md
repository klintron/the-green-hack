# The Green Hack

Made in Oregon by Klint Finley
Based on _The Black Hack_ by David Black
With inspiration from other games, including _Whitehack_ by Christian Mehrstam, _Sharp Swords & Sinister Spells_ by Diogo Nogueira, and of course the Original 1970s Fantasy Roleplaying Game.

## Whatâ€™s this?

The Green Hack (TGH) is a traditional tabletop roleplaying game, played with paper, pencils and dice. The game's design goal is to be broadly compatible with TSR-editions of the Original Roleplaying game while being as compact, easy to learn, easy to teach, and smooth to play as possible.

### How is this different from _The Black Hack_?

_The Green Hack_ replaces the combat system from _The Black Hack_ with one inspired by _The White Hack_. It's designed for fast and smooth combat while maintaining rough compatibility with old school versions of the original game. To that end, it adds two derived attributes: Melee (MEL) and Ranged Attack (RAN) and uses an Armor Class based system.

### What about _Macchiato Monsters_?

_Macchiato Monsters_ also combines elements of _The Black Hack_ and _Whitehack_. But _Macchiato Monsters_ mostly leaves _The Black Hack_ combat system intact while importing the magic system from _Whitehack_. _The Green Hack_ is sort of the opposite: it leaves _The Black Hack_ magic system intact while bringing in a combat system similar to that of _Whitehack_.

### How else does it differ from The Black Hack ver 1?

- Warrior class is pretty different.
- All classes have a few extra features, particularly as they advance.
- Players don't roll to increase stats as they level up.
- Rules for Opposed Rolls, when player characters are in conflict with each other or with noteworthy non-player characters.
- Rules for fighting swarms of opponents.
- Rules for Backgrounds are "Backported" from _The Black Hack_ version 2.
- "Cure Light Wounds" explicitly heals paralysis.
- Probably other stuff I've forgotten about.
