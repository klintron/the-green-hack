# The Green Hack SRD

Made in Oregon by Klint Finley Based on _The Black Hack_ by David Black With inspiration from other games, including _Whitehack_ by Christian Mehrstam, _Sharp Swords & Sinister Spells_ by Diogo Nogueira, and of course the Original 1970s Fantasy Roleplaying Game.

## What's this?

The Green Hack (TGH) is a traditional tabletop roleplaying game, played with paper, pencils and dice. The game's design goal is to be broadly compatible with TSR-editions of the Original Roleplaying game while being as compact, easy to learn, easy to teach, and smooth to play as possible.

### How is this different from The Black Hack?

_The Green Hack_ replaces the combat system from _The Black Hack_ with one inspired by _The White Hack_. It's designed for fast and smooth combat while maintaining rough compatibility with old school versions of the original game. To that end, it adds two derived attributes: Melee (MEL) and Ranged Attack (RAN) and uses an Armor Class based system.

### What about _Macchiato Monsters_?

_Macchiato Monsters_ also combines elements of _The Black Hack_ and _Whitehack_. But _Macchiato Monsters_ mostly leaves _The Black Hack_ combat system intact while importing the magic system from _Whitehack_. _The Green Hack_ is sort of the opposite: it leaves _The Black Hack_ magic system intact while bringing in a combat system similar to that of _Whitehack_.

### How else does it differ from The Black Hack ver 1?

- Warrior and Thief classes are pretty different.
- The Core Mechanic is roll equal to or less than stat, instead of less than stat.
- All classes have a few extra features, particularly as they advance.
- Players don't roll to increase stats as they level up.
- Rules for Opposed Rolls, when player characters are in conflict with each other or with noteworthy non-player characters.
- Rules for fighting swarms of opponents.
- Rules for Backgrounds are "Backported" from _The Black Hack_ version 2.
- "Cure Light Wounds" explicitly heals paralysis.
- Probably other stuff I've forgotten about.

## The core mechanic

Everything a character might possibly attempt that could result in failure is resolved by testing attribute stats, in order to successfully test a stat - a player must roll **equal to or below** it on a d20. The higher the roll while staying below the relevant stat, the better. In certain cases players may also need to roll **equal to or above** a particular number as well.

Monsters don't make tests - a character must avoid their attacks by making a test, the only time a monster would roll is for damage.

## Rolling stats

**Stats** are generated with 3d6 in the following order **Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), Charisma (CHA)**. Once all stats are generated 2 may be swapped around.

There are also two additional stats: **Melee (MEL)** and Ranged **(RAN)**. Melee and Ranged both start at 13.

Characters with a **STR** above 13 will start with **MEL** 15, and those with a **STR** below 8 will start with **MEL** 11.

Characters with a **DEX** above 16 will start with **RAN** 15, and those with a **DEX** below 8 will start with **RAN** 11.

## Choose a class

There are 4 choices. Warrior, Cleric, Conjurer, Thief - your class determines how much damage you do, your Hit Points, and unique abilities.

## Make a background

Use the information on the next page to create a unique piece of history that will aid the Character on their adventures, frame their story, and who they are.

### Using a character's background

**Backgrounds** are significant times in a character's past life that give them **Advantages** in their current exploits. They can represent all manner of experiences, skills and moments in a character's past - helping define who they were before their current adventures, and what type of actions they are good at now.

### How to make a good background

Decide on a short sentence that encapsulates an interesting time in the character's past - consider the following:

- Backgrounds should ideally contain one piece of world-building fiction, allowing a Player to craft a narrative tie to the game world, and a story element unique to their Character.
- It should also reveal one specific skill or narrow field of proficiency or knowledge, that they learned or relied upon during this time.

_Here are some short example backgrounds and a table of inspiration to help get started:_

"Once spent a summer in Yvesh hunting the Black Banner. Made a lot of enemies. Tracked down most of them 'n' killed 'em." "I was raised as a sewer child of Sorrowset, pickpocketing and hiding in the shadows was my way of survival."

"Being raised up to Brother Chaplain in the 11th Legion taught me all I need to know about tactical warfare and death."

"I lived with the Black Hill tribes. I learned to live off the land. Learned to hate the Black Baron's dog soldiers too."

"I'm a Loremaster for the Magisteriat of Bulgator Craxis - the ONLY thing I don't know is why the Council want me dead."

"A hefty price is on my head from the Black Bank! They don't take kindly to being conned out of large sums of money."

"The Black Wind took me from the forest in my youth. Humans of Gloomhaven raised orphaned elves such as myself."

"It's been 100 years since I was young - but by my beard I know nothing of the surface - the deep mountain highways are like veins to my heart - a true dwarf."

### D12 inspiration

1. Raised as a poor street child
2. Escaped being held prisoner
3. Won freedom through valour
4. Reputation ruined by vices
5. Fleeing a broken noble house
6. Sold to a wizard as a child
7. Fought a distant, useless war
8. Smuggler of illegal goods
9. Chosen as a god's instrument
10. Survived an arcane disaster
11. Child of political exiles
12. Lost heir to an old throne

## Buy equipment

Every new character starts with 3d6 x 10 coins with which to buy their equipment. They also start with a set of clothes and a one-handed weapon as allowed by their class.

## Armor Class (AC)

| Type | Class |
| --- | --- |
| None | 7 |
| Gambeson | 8 |
| Leather | 9 |
| Chain Mail | 11 |
| Plate & Mail | 13 |
| Small shield | + 1 |
| Large shield | + 2 |

Characters with DEX greater than 15 should add 2 to their **AC**. Characters with DEX lower than 7 should subtract 2 from their **AC**.

Note: To convert from a traditional descending **AC** value, subtract the descending **AC** value from 16.

**Example:** \_To convert a descending armor class of 3 (plate & mail) to TGH's ascending armor class value: 16 - 3 = 13.

Because attacks are based on opponent **HD** , not **AC** (See **Opponent HD** below), you shouldn't have to convert descending **AC** value often.

| ITEM | COST (Gold) | USAGE DIE | NOTES |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gambeson | 4 | - | 8 Armor Class |
| Leather | 5 | - | 9 Armor Class |
| Chain Mail | 75 | - | 11 Armor Class |
| Plate & Mail | 400 | - | 13 Armor Class |
| Shield Small/Large | 10/15 | - | +1/+2 Armor Class |
| Backpack | 2 | - | Carry +2 extra |
| Flask of oil | 1 | d6 | - |
| Work Tools | 2 | - | - |
| Holy Symbol, wood | 1 | - | +2 to WIS when banishing |
| Holy Water | 25 | d4 | - |
| Iron Spikes | .1 | - | - |
| Lantern | 7 | - | - |
| Handheld mirror | 5 | - | - |
| Preserved Rations | 5 | d8 | - |
| Fresh Rations | 3 | d4 | - |
| 50' Rope | .5 | - | - |
| Small Sack | .1 | - | - |
| Large Sack | .2 | - | - |
| Thieves Tools | 30 | - | - |
| Flint & Steel | 1 | - | - |
| Torches (6) | .5 | d6 | Each Torch has a Usage Die |
| Wineskin | .2 | d6 | - |
| Wine, pint | 1 | - | - |
| Assorted Common Herbs | .5 | d8 | - |
| 10' Pole | .1 | - | - |
| Quiver of Arrows / Bolts | 1 | d10 | - |
| 2-Handed Weapon | 25 | - | - |

## Converting saves

The Green Hack ignores saves and instead asks the player to roll attribute tests when any spell, trap or effect would impact them - using the below as a guide.

| STR | DEX | CON |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Physical Harm that _cannot_ be dodged. | Physical Harm that _can_ be dodged. | Poison, Disease or Death.
 |
| INT | WIS | CHA |
| Resisting Spells and Magic. | Deception and Illusions. | Charming effects. |

## Players turn

During a player's turn a character may move and perform an action. They could attack, look for a clue, talk with an NPC, cast a spell - interacting with the world is an action. Often they will test their attributes to determine the outcome.

## Time & turns

There are 3 important types of tracked time - **Rounds** (~1 minute), **Turns** (~10 minutes), and **Segments** (around 6 seconds). **Rounds** and **Segments** are used during combat and fast paced scenes of danger and **Turns** are used when exploring and adventuring. A GM may advance the clock as they need substituting **Turns** for **Hours** , **Days** or even **Months** should the adventure require it.

## Movement & distance

Rather than track precise numbers, TGH uses 4 abstract ranges for measuring distances. **Close** , **Nearby** , **Far-Away** and **Distant**. On their turn every character can move somewhere **Nearby** as part of an action, performing that action at any stage of the move. They can forgo their action and move somewhere **Far-Away** instead. Anything beyond **Far-Away** can be classified as **Distant** and would take 3 moves to get to.

This system is designed to support the narrative 'theatre of the mind' style of play, and is less concerned about tracking squares and fiddly distances. For converting existing movement rates or measures (for spells or areas of effect) use the following as a guide :

| CLOSE | NEARBY | FAR AWAY |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 - 5ft | 5 - 60ft | 60 - 120ft |

## Initiative

When combat breaks out, everyone must be sorted into an order so they each get to act and react in turn. Every character tests their **DEX** , those that succeed, take their turn before their opponents, they must then act as a group - deciding their own order for actions. Those that fail their **DEX** tests, go after their opponents.

## Opponent HD

**HD** represents an opponent's level and the number of d8 rolled to determine its HP.

## Attacking, defending & damage

When a character attacks an opponent they must roll below their own **MELEE** or **RANGE** stat and above the opponent's level or **HD**. When an opponent attacks, the character must roll below their own **AC** and above the attacker's level or **HD**.

If an opponent's HD is higher than a character's **MEL** or **RAN** , the character can't harm the opponent. If an opponent's **HD** is higher than a character's **AC** , the character can't deflect that opponent's attack.

The damage an attack deals is based on the character's class or the number of **HD** a monster has.

To make a **Melee Attack** an opponent must be **Close**. **Ranged Attacks** against **Close** opponents are possible, but the attacker suffers a **Disadvantage**.

**Opponents** deal damage based on their **HD** - _refer to the table opposite_, but if you'd prefer to use the damage stats listed in a module that you are playing, you can certainly do that instead.

| Monster HD | Damage |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | d4 (2) |
| 2 | d6 (3) |
| 3 | 2d4 (4) |
| 4 | d10 (5) |
| 5 | d12 (6) |
| 6 | d6 + d8 (7) |
| 7 | 2d8 (8) |
| 8 | 3d6 (9) |
| 9 | 2d10 (10) |
| 10 | d10 + d12 (11) |

## Critical damage

If a player making an attack rolls the highest number they can while still succeeding (rolling equal to their **MEL** or **RAN** ), they double the result of the damage dice they roll. If they roll a 20 when avoiding an attack, they take double damage.

## Swarm Attacks

When the party is drastically outnumbered, their opponents can attack as a **Swarm**. A Swarm will have 1/5th of the total HD of the opponents that comprise it, and will attack all members of the party for 1d6 damage. PCs can either flee the Swarm or attack it as a single entity with HP dependent on its HD.

**Example:** _A party of four level 4 characters falls through a trap door into a pit with 100 goblins. The_ _goblins_ _have 1HD each, so the Swarm has HD20, which means the PCs can't hurt the swarm or dodge its attacks. The players roll initiative, and only the Thief passes their DEX test. The Thief spends their turn throwing their grappling out of the trap door. The Swarm then attacks, dealing 1d6 to each character. Then it's the remaining PCs' turn. The Conjurer casts Stone Wall, enclosing all but 10 of the goblins. That's a more fair fight, so the goblins can no longer attack as a swarm._

## Death & dying

When a character is reduced to zero **Hit Points (HP)** they are taken **Out of Action (OofA)**, they are unconscious and cannot make any actions. When the fight is over/are out of danger, a character that is taken **OofA** can roll on the table (_following page_) to see what happens to them. **If they survive they gain 1d4 HP**.

_If the characters lose the fight or are unable to recover the body of the character, they are lost forever!_

## Resting

Once per day, after resting, they may roll a **Hit Die** associated with their class and regain that many **HP**.

##

## Healing

Characters can gain Hit Points from Spells, Potions, and Abilities. They can never gain more than their maximum - and can never go below zero either. When healing a character who is **OofA** , just start at zero and count up. That character is now back on their feet and no longer **OofA**.

| OUT | OF ACTION |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **KO'd** - Just knocked out. |
| 2 | **Fat Head** - Disadvantage on all tests for the next hour. |
| 3 | **Cracked Bones** - STR, DEX and CON are temp. -2 for the next day. |
| 4 | **Crippled** - STR or DEX is permanently reduced by 2 |
| 5 | **Disfigured** - CHA reduced to 4. |
| 6 | **Dead** - Not alive anymore. |

## Advantage & disadvantage

A GM may decide that a particular course of action or task has a higher or lower chance of success. They will ask a player to roll an additional d20 when making a test - with **advantage** the lower result is used and with **disadvantage** , the higher.

## Using background to gain advantage

Once per session, a **Player** may tell the **GM** that their **Character** is using a **Background** to aid them in making an **Attribute Test**. The **Player** should give a convincing narrative explanation as to how their **Character's Background** relates to the current **Action** , and provide some kind of useful exposition about the **Character's** story. If the **GM** agrees - the **Player** may roll that **Attribute Test** with **Advantage**.

## Opposed Rolls

To settle a contest between two PCs, have each player roll versus the relevant stat for the conflict. **Advantage** and **Disadvantage** apply. Whichever player rolls the higher number while staying below their relevant stat wins.

Example:

_Two warriors are arm wrestling. They each have a_ _ **STR** _ _of 16. The first rolls a 12, which is below their_ _ **STR** __, but the second rolls a 14, which is also below their_ _ **STR**__ , so the second wins the arm-wrestling contest._

## Experience

Adventurers learn through defeating and overcoming obstacles. Killing one boring Kobold won't bring a revelation of learning to someone. Surviving a dungeon, completing a quest or simply living to tell the tale are the things that bring perspective and growth. The old experience system has been completely discarded.

For every session / dungeon level / quest / major event the character survives they gain a level.

_The GM will decide which, and it's recommended that this decision remains more or less a constant throughout the campaign - and a GM should be clear and upfront with the players so they know where the 'goalposts' are._

## Gaining levels

When a character levels up, their maximum **Hit Points** increase by rolling the **Hit Die** for the class.

## Encumbrance

A character can carry a number of items equal to their **STR** with no issues. Carrying over this amount means they are encumbered and all attribute tests are taken with **Disadvantage** - you can also only ever move to somewhere **Nearby**. They simply cannot carry more than double their **STR**.

## Class weapons

When using a weapon not listed in their class, combat tests have **Disadvantage**.

## Creature reactions

Some monsters and NPCs will have predetermined personalities and goals that will guide a GM when choosing their actions and feelings towards the characters. Those that do not, such as randomly encountered creatures, make a **Reaction roll** on the following table :

| Roll | Reaction |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Flee then roll again. |
| 2 | Avoid the PCs entirely. |
| 3 | Trade with PCs. |
| 4 | Give the PCs aid. |
| 5 | Mistake the PCs for friends. |
| 6 | Trick the PCs (roll again) |
| 7 | Call for Reinforcements. |
| 8 | Capture/Kill/Eat the PCs. |

## Banishing undead

Clerics can attempt to banish all nearby undead as an action. They must successfully test their **WIS** for each group of creatures they are attempting to banish, rolling over the creature's **HD**. A GM will determine which creatures are in any particular group.

Undead monsters that are **Banished** by Clerics must spend all their movement (and convert actions to movement) to move away from the Cleric for 2d4 **Rounds** after being **Banished**.

## Usage die

Any item listed in the equipment section that has a **Usage die** is considered a consumable, limited item. When that item is used the next **Minute** (turn) its **Usage die** is rolled. If the roll is 1-2 then the usage die is downgraded to the next lower die in the following chain:

**d20 \> d12 \> d10 \> d8 \> d6 \> d4**

When you roll a 1-2 on a d4 the item is expended and the character has no more of it left.

## Magic items

Magic weapons typically add +1 to any attribute being tested whilst using the weapon and +1 to each damage dice rolled. More powerful weapons (+2/3) can be found if the GM includes them.

##

## Warrior

**Starting HP :** d10 + 4 **HP Per Level/Resting :** 1d10 **Weapons & Armor :** Any and All **Attack Damage :** 1d8 / 1d6 Unarmed or Improvising

### Special features

Once per hour, whilst in combat, a Warrior can regain d8 lost **HP**.

Any character can perform combat maneuvers (disarming, tripping, pushing) in place of a normal attack. A Warrior can attack and perform a **STR** or **DEX** based maneuver at the same time (for example, pushing an opponent backwards with their blow, disarming an opponent, or leaping into melee range of a **Nearby** opponent.).

If a Warrior fails an **AC** test and would be dealt damage from an attack, they can opt to sunder (destroy) their shield - if they have one equipped - and ignore the damage.

Once per combat, a Warrior can sacrifice their next turn to thrust themselves between any **Close** character and take the damage from a blow that character would otherwise take. The Warrior must take the full brunt of the damage and can't sunder their shield during this maneuver.

### Leveling up

**At Level 2:** - New Feature: Take two attacks per turn in combat.

**At level 4:** - Increase **MEL** and **RAN** by 1.

**Hide in Shadows:** All characters can attempt to hide under or behind appropriate objects, but thieves can test **DEX** to hide anywhere with enough shadow to cover them.

**Swashbuckling:** Any character can perform combat maneuvers (disarming, tripping, pushing) in place of a normal attack. A Thief can attack and perform a **DEX** or **CHA** based maneuver at the same time (ex: leaping from **Close** to **Nearby** after attacking, disarming an opponent, or distracting them with a taunt).

**Thieves' Cant:** All thieves know a secret language that they can use to speak with each other either verbally or with hand gestures. There is no written version of the language.

##

## Spellcasting

Conjurers and Clerics have the ability to cast spells that are chosen from their appropriate class list (on the following pages).

They can cast any spell they know by reading from their spellbook or can memorize a number of spells equal to their **Level** and cast those without it.

They have a number of 'spell slots' they can cast each day - as shown in the two tables opposite. These represent a magic user's 'energy' and the taxing nature of casting spells over a long period. When they run out of spell slots, they cannot cast any more spells.

After roughly _ **8 hours rest** _, the number of 'spell slots' a character has refreshes to its maximum.

If a spell from a traditional OSR or original era game calls for a creature to make a save, the character must test their **INT** or **WIS** against the target's HD or level to see if the magic cast was powerful enough to overcome their defenses
